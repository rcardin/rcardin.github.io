I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the Scala Days 2025 in Lausanne. The talk was titled "Yo Dawg, Heard You Want To FlatMap Your Direct-Style". I talked about the challenges of using direct-style programming in Scala and how we can leverage the power of effect systems to make our code more expressive and easier to reason about. The talk was well-received, and I had a great time interacting with the audience and answering their questions.

You can find the slides 📊 for the talk [here](https://github.com/rcardin/scala-days-2025). Here is the video recording:

The talk was an introduction to the concepts behind my library called [YAES](https://github.com/rcardin/yaes). Please leave a star ⭐ if you like it! I am looking for contributors to help me improve the library and add new features. If you're interested, please reach out to me on GitHub or X.
