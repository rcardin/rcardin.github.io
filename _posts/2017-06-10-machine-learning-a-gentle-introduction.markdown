What does this word exactly means? Are we talking about artificial intelligence? Somebody is trying to build Skynet to ruin the world? Machine will steal my job in the future?

Looking at the last Google and Apple conventions it was clear to all: if in the past years the main buzz words in the information technology field were _IoT_ and _Big Data_, the _catch'em all_ word  of this year is without a doubt _Machine Learning_. What does this word exactly means? Are we talking about artificial intelligence? Somebody is trying to build Skynet to ruin the world? Machine will steal my job in the future? "Know your enemy", they said. So let's try to understand what Machine Learning really means.

#### Definitions
The task we are going to accomplish is not simple. So, let's start from the begining: What does _machine learning_ refer to.

> Machine Learning is a discipline of Artificial Intelligence, that is responsible to study and develop algorithms that allows machines to learn information. In detail, the learning process is done using an inductive approach, that tries to extract rules and behavioural patterns from huge amount of data.

The types of information used by the algorithms to learn identify the following categorization of machine learning algorithms, which are:

 1. **Supervised learning**
 2. **Unsupervised learning**
 3. **Reinforcement learning**
