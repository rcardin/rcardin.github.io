summary: "We rely on the JDBC specification if we need to connect to SQL databases in the JVM ecosystem. However, JDBC is not a good fit if we use functional programming since the library performs a lot of side effects. Fortunately, a library called Doobie provides a higher-level API on top of JDBC."
