summary: "In imperative programming languages, we use loops such as for-loop and while-loop to iterate over collections. The Scala programming language introduced a new kind of loop: the for-comprehension. Its use goes far beyond simply looping over collections, helping us to deal with the complexity of the syntax when using a functional approach to programming."

I started to write as a professional technical writer for [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/). Initially, I will focus on writing posts about the Scala programming language.

The first post I wrote for Baeldung is [A Comprehensive Guide to For-Comprehension in Scala](https://www.baeldung.com/scala/for-comprehension). It's a return to the basics of the language, as you may notice.

So, let's have a deep dive into the _for-comprehension_ construct in Scala.
