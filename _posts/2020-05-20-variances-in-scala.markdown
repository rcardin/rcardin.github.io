summary: "In this tutorial, we will be looking at Scala variances. Variance tells us if a type constructor (equivalent to a generic type in Java) is a subtype of another type constructor. We’ll also take a look at the three main types of variance – invariance, covariance, and contravariance – and how they differ."
