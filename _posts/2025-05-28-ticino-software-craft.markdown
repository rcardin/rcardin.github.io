The Ticino Software Craft Meetup gave me the opportunity to give a talk about my library YAES, which is an effect system for Scala. We did an excursus on Effect Systems in Scala, starting from the monadic effects in Cats Effect, going through the ZIO effect system, and Jyo and finally arriving at YAES. 

You can find the slides üìä for the talk [here](https://github.com/rcardin/ticino-software-craft-2025) and the video recording üìπ [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/PEiMZYedD58?si=Ht9SJKVk7M0ArrX6). The talk was an introduction to the concepts behind my library called [YAES](https://github.com/rcardin/yaes). Please leave a star ‚≠ê if you like it! I am looking for contributors to help me improve the library and add new features. If you're interested, please reach out to me on GitHub or X.
