summary: "Version 19 of Java came at the end of 2022, bringing us a lot of exciting stuff. One of the coolest is the preview of some hot topics concerning Project Loom: virtual threads (JEP 425) and structured concurrency (JEP 428). Whereas still in a preview phase, the two JEPs promise to bring modern concurrency paradigms also in the mainstream language of the JVM: The Java programming language."
