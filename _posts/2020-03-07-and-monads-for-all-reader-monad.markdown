Who follows me from the beginning perfectly knows my obsession for the dependency management in programming languages. I have already written of dependency injection mechanisms in modern programming languages. In [Eat that cake!](http://rcardin.github.io/design/2014/08/28/eat-that-cake.html) I wrote about the Cake Pattern and how to use Scala self types to resolve the problem of dependency injection. In [Resolving your problems with Dependency Injection](http://rcardin.github.io/programming/software-design/java/scala/di/2016/08/01/resolve-problems-dependency-injection.html), I introduced the problem of the dependency resolution. In [Resolve me, Implicitly](http://rcardin.github.io/design/scala/2017/10/15/resolve-me-implicitly.html), I showed how to use Scala `implicit`s to implement a dependency injection mechanism. Now its time to speak about how functional programming tries to solve the dependency management issue, using the *Reader Monad*.

## The problem

Imagine you have a type whose responsibility is to manage the persistence of _stocks_ information. Let we call it `StockRepository`. The repository can retrieve all the stocks present in a wallet, can sell a quantity of a stock or can buy some amount of stock. It follows the definition of such a type.

{% highlight scala %}
trait StockRepository {
  def findAll(): Map[String, Double]
  def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double): Double
  def buy(stock: String, amount: Double): Double
}
{% endhighlight %}

The repository implements what we can call _persistence logic_.

Then, we have a type that uses the `StockRepository` to give to its clients some _business logic_ built upon the above _persistence logic_. Let's call it `Stocks`. Imagine that we want to give access to the three functions of the repository, plus a fourth function that invest money in the stock that has the lowest quotation.

1. `findAll()`
2. `sell(stock: String, quantity: Double)`
3. `buy(stock: String, amount: Double)`
4. `investInStockWithMinValue(amount: Double)`

So, `Stocks` has a dependency upon `StockRepository`. How can we express such fact in the code? We don't want to use the _constructor injection_ mechanism or anything related to it. We want to stay _functional_.

## Dependency management within functions

### The trivial solution

An option is to pass a reference of the repository to each function that need to access to its methods.

{% highlight scala %}
object Stocks {
  def findAll(repo: StockRepository): Map[String, Double] = repo.findAll()
  def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double, repo: StockRepository): Double = 
    repo.sell(stock, quantity)
  def buy(stock: String, amount: Double, repo: StockRepository): Double = 
    repo.buy(stock, amount)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This trick does its dirty job, but it pollutes the signature of each function that needs some external dependency. Our example has only one dependency, but in real life, dependencies are often more than one.

### Using currying to isolate dependencies

The _currying_ process can help us to make things a little better. Imagine isolating the dependency parameters using a curried version of the previous functions.

{% highlight scala %}
object Stocks {
  def findAll()(repo: StockRepository): Map[String, Double] = repo.findAll()
  def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double)(repo: StockRepository): Double = 
    repo.sell(stock, quantity)
  def buy(stock: String, amount: Double)(repo: StockRepository): Double = 
    repo.buy(stock, amount)
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you know, the currying process allows us to _partially applied_ a function, obtaining as the result of the partial application a new function with fewer inputs. 

> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.

Let's take an example.

Let the function `def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b` that adds to integers. If we apply currying to the function `add` we obtain the following new function.

{% highlight scala %}
`def add(a: Int) = (b: Int) =>  a + b`
{% endhighlight %}

The return type of the function `add` is not anymore a pure `Int` but now it is a function from `Int => Int`.

If we apply the currying reasoning to the functions of the `Stocks` module, we obtain the following definition.

{% highlight scala %}
object Stocks {
  def findAll(): StockRepository => Map[String, Double] = repo => repo.findAll()
  def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double): StockRepository => Double = 
    repo => repo.sell(stock, quantity)
  def buy(stock: String, amount: Double): StockRepository => Double = 
    repo => repo.buy(stock, amount)
}
{% endhighlight %}

We remove the ugly `StockRepository` parameter from the signature of our function! Yuppi yuppi ya! However, it is complicated to compose functions with the last signature we had :( Imagine that we want to implement the function `investInStockWithMinValue` using the function we developed so far. A possible implementation is the following.

{% highlight scala %}
def investInStockWithMinValue(amount: Double): StockRepository => Unit =
  (repo: StockRepository) => {
    val investment = Stocks.findAll()
      .andThen(s => s.minBy(_._2))
      .andThen{ case (stock, _) => stock }
      .andThen(s => Stocks.buy(s, amount)(repo))
  }
{% endhighlight %}

It is not simple to follow what is going on. The use of the function `andThen` does not help the reader to understand the main workflow of the function, because it is not semantically focused on the operation it is carrying on. Moreover, in the last line, there is a very ugly function application, `Stocks.buy(s, amount)(repo)` that waste our code with a detail that is not related to the business logic but only to the implementation.

We can do better than this. Much better.

## The Reader monad

What if we encapsulate the curried function inside a data structure? Using such an approach is precisely the idea behind the _Reader Monad_.

We have our function, let's say `f: From => To`, where `From` and `To` are respectively the starting type (domain) and the arriving type (codomain) of the function. As we just said, we put a data structure around our function.

{% highlight scala %}
case class Reader[From, To](f: From => To) { /* ... */ }
{% endhighlight %}

We want to apply in some way the function enclosed inside our data structure. We add the application function.

{% highlight scala %}
def apply(input: From): To = f(input)
{% endhighlight %}

To improve the readability of our code, we want to have a function different from `andThen` to compose a function `f`. Given a function `g: To => NewTo`, we need a function to compose `g` with `f` inside a `Reader`. This function is called `map`.

{% highlight scala %}
def map[NewTo](transformation: To => NewTo): Reader[From, NewTo] =
  Reader(c => transformation(f(c)))
{% endhighlight %}

The `flatMap` function composes `f` with functions `z: To => Reader[From, NewTo]`. This function is equal to the last application of the `andThen` method in our previous example.

{% highlight scala %}
def flatMap[NewTo](transformation: To => Reader[From, NewTo]): Reader[From, NewTo] =
  Reader(c => transformation(f(c))(c))
{% endhighlight %}

In other words, the `flatMap` function serves to compose two functions sharing the same dependency. In our example, using a `flatMap`, we can compose the functions `findAll` and `buy` both sharing the dependency among a `StockRepository`. Using a simple `map`, we would obtain the nesting of a `Reader` into another `Reader`.

{% highlight scala %}
val quantity: Reader[StockRepository, Reader[StockRepository, Double]] = 
  Stocks.findAll()
    .map { stocks => 
      val minStock = stocks.minBy(_._2)
      Stocks.buy(minStock, 1000.0D)
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Quite annoying. Using a `flatMap`, instead, we can _flatten_ the result type, and everything goes ok. The function application in the `flatMap` definition does the trick.

{% highlight scala %}
val quantity: Reader[StockRepository, Double] = 
  Stocks.findAll()
    .flatMap { stocks => 
      val minStock = stocks.minBy(_._2)
      Stocks.buy(minStock, 1000.0D)
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we need an action to _lift_ a value of type `To` in a `Reader[From, To]`. In other words, we want to be able to create from a value of type `To` a function that receives a value of type `From` and returns a value of type `To`. This function is not a member of the `Reader` monad itself. It is more like a _factory method_.

{% highlight scala %}
def pure[From, To](a: To): Reader[From, To] = Reader((c: From) => a)
{% endhighlight %}

The whole `Reader` type is something similar to the following.

{% highlight scala %}
object ReaderMonad {
  case class Reader[From, To](f: From => To) {
    def apply(input: From): To =
      f(input)

    def map[NewTo](transformation: To => NewTo): Reader[From, NewTo] =
      Reader(c => transformation(f(c)))

    def flatMap[NewTo](transformation: To => Reader[From, NewTo]): Reader[From, NewTo] =
      Reader(c => transformation(f(c))(c))
  }
  def pure[From, To](a: To): Reader[From, To] = Reader((c: From) => a)
}
{% endhighlight %}

It happens that the type `Reader` satisfies with its functions `apply`, `map` and `flatMap` the minimum properties needed to be a _monad_. The description of the _monad laws_ is behind the scope of this post. 

Moreover, because of the presence of the function `map` and `flatMap`, we can use the type `Reader` in a fashion way to simplify our code.

## Finally, using the monad

First of all, we change the `Stocks` type with the `Reader` monad.

{% highlight scala %}
object Stocks {
  def findAll(): Reader[StockRepository, Map[String, Double]] = Reader {
    repo => repo.findAll()
  }
  def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double): Reader[StockRepository, Double] = Reader {
    repo => repo.sell(stock, quantity)
  }
  def buy(stock: String, amount: Double): Reader[StockRepository, Double] = Reader {
    repo => repo.buy(stock, amount)
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, every direct dependency was removed and substituted with the `Reader[StockRepository, _]` type.
Now, it's time to return to our previous `investInStockWithMinValue` function. Using the methods we defined on the monad, we can rewrite the function as follows.

{% highlight scala %}
def investInStockWithMinValue(amount: Double): Reader[StockRepository, Double] = 
  Stocks.findAll()
    .map(stocks => stocks.minBy(_._2))
    .map { case (stock, _) => stock }
    .flatMap(stock => Stocks.buy(stock, amount))
{% endhighlight %}

Using the syntactic sugar available from the Scala language, we can rewrite the above code use a _for-comprehension_ statement.

{% highlight scala %}
def investInStockWithMinValueUsingForComprehension(amount: Double): Reader[StockRepository, Unit] =
  for {
    stocks <- Stocks.findAll()
    minStock <- ReaderMonad.pure(stocks.minBy(_._2)._1)
    _ <- Stocks.buy(minStock, amount)
  } yield ()
{% endhighlight %}

I love the _for-comprehension_ construct because it is self-explanatory :)

Who is responsible for resolving the dependencies, declared through the `Reader` monad? The answer is simple, that is the `main` method.

{% highlight scala %}
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
  val stockRepo = new StockRepository {
    override def findAll(): Map[String, Double] = Map("AMZN" -> 1631.17, "GOOG" -> 1036.05, "TSLA" -> 346.00)
    override def sell(stock: String, quantity: Double): Double = quantity * findAll()(stock)
    override def buy(stock: String, amount: Double): Double = findAll()(stock) / amount
  }
}

investInStockWithMinValueUsingForComprehension(1000.0D).apply(stockRepo)
{% endhighlight %}

### What if I have more than one dependency?

Very often, we have functions that depend by more than one single dependency. For example, think that you want to add a rate change service to the functions of the `Stock` type. Using `RateChangeService`, it is possible to buy and sell in a currency that is different from dollars.

{% highlight scala %}
def buy(stock: String, amount: Double, currency: String)(repo: StockRepository, changer: RateChangeService) = {
  val dollarAmount = changer.changeToDollar(amount, currency)
  repo.buy(stock, dollarAmount)
}
{% endhighlight %}

The Reader monad we just analyzed handles only one dependency at time. Should we try away all the suitable types we developed until now? No, we shouldn't. If you depend on more than one type, you can create a new container type, something similar to a _context_.

{% highlight scala %}
case class Context(val repo: StockRepository, val changer: RateChangeService)
{% endhighlight %}

In this way, we reduce our function to depend on a single type again, our `Context` type. Ball, game, set.

{% highlight scala %}
def buy(stock: String, amount: Double): Reader[Context, Double] = Reader {
    ctx => {
      val dollarAmount = ctx.changer.changeToDollar(amount, currency)
      ctx.repo.buy(stock, amount)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusions

In this post, we analyzed how to declare dependencies in functions. We begin from the simplest possible solution, and we composed step by step a more elegant and practice solution that is called the `Reader` monad. Finally, we showed how the monad could simplify the code through the use of the _for-comprehension_ construct.

The code of the `Reader` monad is available on my GitHub, [reader-monad](https://github.com/rcardin/reader-monad). I also developed a version of the monad in Kotlin, for the lovers of this emergent programming language, [reader-monad-kotlin](https://github.com/rcardin/reader-monad-kotlin).
