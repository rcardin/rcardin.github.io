summary: "A Future in Scala allows us to treat concurrency in a declarative way, hiding the complexity of asynchronous programming. We can map a Future, changing the value computed concurrently. But, what about a failed Future? Can we map something that fails into a new value? In this tutorial, weâ€™ll explain exactly how to do just that."
