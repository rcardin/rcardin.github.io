summary: "It’s time to end our journey on functional error handling in Kotlin with the new features introduced by the Arrow library in version 1.2.0, which previews the significant rewrite we’ll have in version 2.0.0. We’ll mainly focus on the Raise DSL, a new way to handle typed errors using Kotlin contexts."
