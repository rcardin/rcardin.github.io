summary: "In this article, we delve into the concept of type classes in Kotlin, a powerful tool that allows developers to abstract logic for different data types. We’ll take data validation as an example to show how type classes can be used to write generic and reusable code. Our implementation will be based on the Arrow Kt library, which will exploit Kotlin’s context receivers. "
