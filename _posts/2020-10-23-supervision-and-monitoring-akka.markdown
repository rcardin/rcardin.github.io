summary: "The reactive manifesto, the guideline for all reactive systems, states that a distributed application should be resilient. To achieve resiliency, we must develop systems that treat failure as a first-class citizen in the architecture. The Akka library, through the mechanism of supervision, provides the primitives to implement resilient systems. In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to show how to use Akka and supervision to improve the resiliency of distributed systems."
