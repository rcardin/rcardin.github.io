summary: "The reactive manifesto, the guideline for all reactive systems, states that a distributed application should be resilient. To achieve resiliency, we must develop systems that treat failure as a first-class citizen in the architecture. The Akka library, through the mechanism of supervision, provides the primitives to implement resilient systems. In this tutorial, we’re going to show how to use Akka and supervision to improve the resiliency of distributed systems."
