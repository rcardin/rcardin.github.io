Hi all! My name is **Riccardo**. I am currently working as a solution developer of Java based
applications (both backend and frontend) in financial domain, i.e. Banks and Assurances.
I am also one of the two main lecturers of the [Software Engineering](http://www.math.unipd.it/~rcardin/sweb.html)
course inside the Computer Science Bsc, hosted by [Dipartimento di Matematica](http://www.math.unipd.it/) of
the [University of Padova](http://www.unipd.it/).

I am strongly interested in the application of design pattern and design best practices.
I am trying to constantly increase my knowledge about software's design and development.
My main programming skill is object oriented programming using Java. I am currently trying to
master also functional programming, mainly using Scala and Java 8, and actors-driven development
using Akka.
