Hi, I'm **Riccardo** — a software engineer, conference speaker, and university lecturer based in Italy.

I work on JVM-based systems in the financial domain and lecture on [Software Engineering](http://www.math.unipd.it/~rcardin/sweb.html) at the [University of Padova](http://www.unipd.it/).

I write about **Scala**, **Kotlin**, and **Java** — with a focus on functional programming, effect systems, design patterns, and concurrency. You'll find deep dives on topics like ZIO, Akka, Kotlin Coroutines, Arrow, virtual threads, and more.

I also contribute articles to [Rock the JVM](https://blog.rockthejvm.com) and [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com), and speak at conferences like Scala Days and Scalar.

Feel free to connect with me on any of the social links below.
