summary: "I am a big fan of SOLID programming principles by Robert C. Martin. In particular, I thought that the Single Responsibility Principle was one of the most powerful among these principles, yet one of the most misleading. Its definition gives not any rigorous detail on how to apply it. Every developer is left to his own experiences an knowledge to defined what a responsibility is. Well, maybe I found a way to standardize the application of this principle during the development process. Let me explain how."

I am a big fan of SOLID programming principles by Robert C. Martin. In my opinion, Uncle Bob did a great work when it first defined them in its books. In particular, I thought that the Single Responsibility Principle was one of the most powerful among these principles, yet one of the most misleading. Its definition gives not any rigorous detail on how to apply it. Every developer is left to his own experiences an knowledge to defined what a responsibility is. Well, maybe I found a way to standardize the application of this principle during the development process. Let me explain how.
