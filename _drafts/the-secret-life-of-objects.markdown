summary: "I was in the world of software development for a bit now, and if I understood a single thing is that programming is not a simple affair. And, Object-Oriented programming is even less easier. The idea that I had of what an *object* is immediatly after I ended the University is very far from the idea I have now. Last week I came across a blog post "Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming. After having read it, I fully understand how easily Object-Oriented programming can be misundestood at many level. I am not saying that I have the last answer to milion dollar question, but I will try to give a different perspective of my undestanding of Object-Oriented programming."

I was in the world of software development for a bit now, and if I understood a single thing is that programming is not a simple affair. And, Object-Oriented programming is even less easier. The idea that I had of what an *object* is immediatly after I ended the University is very far from the idea I have now. Last week I came across a blog post [Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming](https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53). After having read it, I fully understand how easily Object-Oriented programming can be misundestood at many level. I am not saying that I have the last answer to milion dollar question, but I will try to give a different perspective of my undestanding of Object-Oriented programming.

## Introduction 

Probably, this will be the harder post I have ever written by now. It is not a simple affair to reason to the basis of Object-Ortiented programming. I think that the first thing we should do is to define _what an object is_.

Once, I have tried to give a definition to _objects_:
