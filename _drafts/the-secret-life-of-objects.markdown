summary: "I was in the world of software development for a bit now, and if I understood a single thing is that programming is not a simple affair. And, Object-Oriented programming is even less easier. The idea that I had of what an *object* is immediatly after I ended the University is very far from the idea I have now. Last week I came across a blog post "Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming. After having read it, I fully understand how easily Object-Oriented programming can be misundestood at many level. I am not saying that I have the last answer to milion dollar question, but I will try to give a different perspective of my undestanding of Object-Oriented programming."
