summary: "Which is the main problem you have as a developer when you use libraries that you don't own? You can't change them. If something is missing in the public API of a library, there is no chance to extend it. Using some good old object-oriented programming, you can overcome this problem writing a lot of boilerplate code. In the JVM ecosystem, modern programming languages, such as Scala, Kotlin or Groovy, try to give a solution to library extension, the Pimp My Library Pattern."

Which is the main problem you have as a developer when you use libraries that you don't own? You can't change them. If something is missing in the public API of a library, there is no chance to extend it. Using some good old object-oriented programming, you can overcome this problem writing a lot of boilerplate code. In the JVM ecosystem, modern programming languages, such as Scala, Kotlin or Groovy, try to give a solution to library extension, the Pimp My Library Pattern. Let's go, and see what I am talking about.
