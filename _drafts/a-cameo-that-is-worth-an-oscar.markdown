summary: "Rarely, during my life as a developer, I found pre-packaged solutions that fits my problem so well. Design patterns are abstraction of both problems and solutions. So, they often need some kind of customization on the specific problem. While I was developing my concrete instance of Actorbase specification, I came across the Cameo pattern. It enlighted my way and my vision about how to use Actors profitably. Let's see how and why."

Rarely, during my life as a developer, I found pre-packaged solutions that fits my problem so well. Design patterns are abstraction of both problems and solutions. So, they often need some kind of customization on the specific problem. While I was developing my concrete instance of [Actorbase specification](http://rcardin.github.io/database/actor-model/reactive/akka/scala/2016/02/07/actorbase-or-the-persistence-chaos.html), I came across the **Cameo pattern**. It enlighted my way and my vision about how to use Actors profitably. Let's see how and why.
