summary: "I am not an expert of functional programming, nor of type theory. I am currently trying to enter
in the world of Haskell, after I mess around the Scala world for a while. When I read about Kinds,
I remember I was surprise, and a little bit scared. Is it possible that types have types? And,
what does this mean? In this little introductory post, I will try to explain myself what I understood
during my journey through kinds in my Haskell travelling,"

I am not an expert of functional programming, nor of type theory. I am currently trying to enter

during my journey through kinds in my Haskell travelling.
